 This is a book with a table of contents, chapters, sections and subsections.
 Your task is to return the data structure in the dictionary format (JSON) called structure.json.

The file provided to you does not contain the text of the book. 
Your goal is to process the PDF file in such a way as to extract the text of all chapters, sections and subsections, 
and add them to the dictionary as keys, following the structure of structure.json.

 The best option would be a solution that does not require the use of a structure.json file
 (for example, a solution with a function that creates this structure automatically). 
 A solution using a structure.json file would also be acceptable.
